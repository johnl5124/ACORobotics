## ALPHA 1.0
- [x] Movement (L, R, F, B) (22/01/2022)
- [x] Ultrasound (22/01/2022)
- [x] Ultrasond-based movement:
  - [x] Stopping based on proxmity
  - [x] Choosing direction or backing out from dead end
- [x] Camera implementation (22/01/2022)

## BETA 2.0
- [ ] Node dropping - N/A
	- [ ] Node weightings - N/A
- [ ] Planar graph implementation - N/A
- [ ] Short-path implementation - N/A

## Testing
- [ ] ALPHA testing
	- [ ] Move through maze unaided 
- [ ] BETA testing

## QoL, Future Updates and Extras
- [ ] User-input GPIO reset
- [ ] Ultrasonic burst and movement combined into one so they can run alongside
